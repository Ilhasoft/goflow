# Router Tests

Router tests are a special class of functions which are used within the switch router. They are called in the same way as normal functions, but 
all return a test result object which by default evalutes to true or false, but can also be used to find the matching portion of the test by using
the `match` component of the result. The flow editor builds these expressions using UI widgets, but they can be used anywhere a normal template
function is used.
